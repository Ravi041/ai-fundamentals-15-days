# Style Guide

Shared visual and audio rules for every lecture video.

### Visual style (apply to every scene)

- **Resolution and format:** 3840 x 2160 (4K UHD), 16:9, 30 fps, H.264 or ProRes master. Title-safe margins of 5% on all sides.
- **Background:** warm cream paper, solid `#F7F1E3`, with a very subtle paper grain and a soft vignette. Never pure white, never dark mode.
- **Ink and text:** charcoal `#2B2B2B` for text and outlines; secondary text `#6B6458`; soft shadows `#E6DCC6`.
- **Part accent color:** the part color (see table below) for highlights, active elements and the progress bar. Supporting accents: mustard `#E9C46A`, muted red `#C8553D` (only for errors, myths and warnings).
- **Typography:** rounded geometric sans (e.g. Poppins or Inter) for headings, 96 to 140 px; body labels 48 to 64 px. Code in a monospace font (e.g. JetBrains Mono) at 44 px or larger on a rounded off-white code card `#FFFBF2` with a thin charcoal border.
- **Illustration style:** flat 2D explainer graphics, thick rounded outlines (6 to 8 px at 4K), soft drop shadows, simple icons, no photorealism, no stock footage.
- **Motion:** smooth ease-in-out, 0.4 to 0.8 s per element, gentle overshoot on pop-ins, elements build in one idea at a time. Camera moves are slow pushes and pans only. No flashing, no fast cuts.
- **Mascot:** "Token", a small round friendly robot drawn in the same flat style, appears on the journey map and occasionally reacts in scenes.
- **Web page references:** show each public doc page inside a clean rounded browser-window frame (no real browser chrome, just three dots and the URL in a pill), floating on the cream background with a soft shadow. Zoom and highlight the relevant section with an accent-colored rounded rectangle and an arrow callout. Show the URL clearly at the bottom of the frame for 3 seconds or more.
- **Logos:** use plain text labels for company and model names instead of official logos unless brand assets are licensed.

### Audio

- **No AI narration.** The host records the voice-over separately. Leave the voice-over track empty.
- Light, warm background music bed at about -28 LUFS, ducking under voice. Soft UI sound effects (pops, whooshes, clicks) at low volume.
- Keep each scene's visuals readable without audio, and hold the final state of each beat 1 to 2 seconds so it can be stretched to match the voice-over.
